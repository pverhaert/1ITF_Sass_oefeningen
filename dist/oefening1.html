<h1>Werken met <span>partials</span></h1>
<p>With <span>CSS</span>, all of your code is contained in a single document and with each new feature this document
    increases in
    complexity while decreasing in readability and maintainability.
</p>
<p><span>Sass</span> gives us the power to break our code into smaller, easier to manage chunks of code called partials.
</p>
<p>A partial is any file with an underscore _ preceding the name. When Sass sees these files, it will not process them
    into CSS files. A partial requires that it be imported into another file that will inevitability be processed into
    CSS in order for it to be output.
</p>
<p>The order in which you list your imports is the order that Sass will follow when processing your code. If the
    selector you wrote requires a mixin to be loaded before it is used, be sure to list the file containing the mixin
    prior to the file that uses the mixin.
