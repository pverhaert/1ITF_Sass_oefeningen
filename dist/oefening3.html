    <h1>Mixins</h1>
    <p>Using the @mixin directive you can engineer smart and reusable code to be used throughout your application.
    </p>
    <p>When using mixins within selectors, the placement of mixins has a direct impact on the cascade of your output
        CSS. The role of a mixin is to physically inject, or mix-in code, where referenced. When a mixin is randomly
        placed into a selector, depending on what is in the mixin, this could either accidentally over-write a preceding
        CSS rule or you may unknowingly write a CSS rule that is duplicated by the mixin.
    </p>
    <p>Consistency plays a huge role in clean code. When mixins are always in a consistently
        expected location, this will help other authors be able to quickly scan and edit code.
